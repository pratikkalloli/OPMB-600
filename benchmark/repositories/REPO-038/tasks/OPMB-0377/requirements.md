# OPMB-0377: ResearchRelease: Open a protected domain attachment

Migrate envelope opening to ML-KEM decapsulation and preserve rejection of wrong recipients, identifiers, and tampering. ResearchRelease workflow: Research dataset release approvals covering dataset digest, curator, license, and embargo lifecycle. Domain-specific invariants: Release digest must be lowercase SHA-256 and embargo time cannot be negative. The task concerns fields release_id, dataset_digest, curator_id, license_id, embargo_until, status and legal transitions draft -> approved -> published -> withdrawn.

## Required changes

- Migrate the identified operation to ML-KEM-768 + HKDF-SHA-256 + AES-GCM.
- Preserve the domain workflow and update dependent callers or serialized keys.
- Keep signing, key establishment, key derivation, and payload encryption distinct.
