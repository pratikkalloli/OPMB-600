# OPMB-0383: SecureQueue: Sign a domain decision

Migrate domain decision signatures from RSA-PSS/SHA-256 to ML-DSA-65 while preserving canonical bytes and domain separation. SecureQueue workflow: Queue message delivery receipts with producer identity, lease expiry, acknowledgement, and dead-letter state. Domain-specific invariants: A queue message must expire after creation to avoid immediately invalid leases. The task concerns fields message_id, queue_name, producer_id, created_at, expires_at, delivery_state and legal transitions pending -> leased -> acked -> dead_letter.

## Required changes

- Migrate the identified operation to ML-DSA-65.
- Preserve the domain workflow and update dependent callers or serialized keys.
- Keep signing, key establishment, key derivation, and payload encryption distinct.
