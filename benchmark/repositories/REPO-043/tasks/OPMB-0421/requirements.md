# OPMB-0421: PhotoVault: Validate and canonicalize the domain entity

Preserve required fields, canonical encoding, identifier binding, and legal lifecycle states as signed domain records migrate. PhotoVault workflow: Photo object lifecycle with owner, content digest, classification, retention, and explicit sharing state. Domain-specific invariants: Photo retention must be positive and classification must use the vault policy vocabulary. The task concerns fields photo_id, owner_id, content_digest, classification, retention_days, lifecycle and legal transitions private -> shared -> revoked -> expired.

## Required changes

- Migrate the identified operation to ML-DSA-65.
- Preserve the domain workflow and update dependent callers or serialized keys.
- Keep signing, key establishment, key derivation, and payload encryption distinct.
